The history of advertising has always been closely linked with that of the mass media. From the ancient simple advertisements painted on outdoor signs to the colourful, interactive ones in smartphone apps, advertising and the mass media have developed hand in hand. As media channels have grown in number and type, so have advertisements.
Because the mass media reaches so many people, it is a perfect vehicle for advertisers. If an advertisement is placed on a popular website or on TV at peak times, a huge number of people will know about the product or service it is advertising. In addition to making people aware of a product or service, a successful advertisement will also create a desire to buy, thus boosting business. That is why when a company wants to promote a product or service, it often launches a mass media advertising campaign.
Based on the psychology behind creating a desire to buy, advertisers have developed ways of persuading people into purchasing their products or services. A common technique to make an impact is to create a memorable slogan. Slogans use simple but impressive language to make us remember the product or service being
advertised. Some of these slogans may also appeal to our emotions. For example,a slogan may connect a fine china teapot it aims to promote with our pride in having good taste.
You will hear a variety of slogans any time you watch TV. Think about your favourite one. What makes it special? And what message does it try to get across? A slogan which communicates an idea effectively can boost sales and even become part of popular culture. That is the power of memorable slogans.
